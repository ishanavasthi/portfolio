# My Personal Website 🌐

- A [personal website](https://ishanavasthi.in?utm_source=GitHub) made using HTML & CSS to showcase my projects 💻, skills ✍🏻, achievements 🏆 and socials 🖼.

- Website Link - https://ishanavasthi.in/

- It even has a contact me button on bottom right, wherein if a user sends any message, it is delivered to me via a Telegram Bot. This is way better than getting an email for a contact request, as I check Telegram more frequently and it helps me keep my Email inbox clean.
